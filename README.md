## Introduction

EtherWalletKit is an Ethereum Wallet Toolkit for iOS.<br><br>
I hope cryptocurrency and decentralized token economy become more widely adapted.
However, some developers hesitate to add a crypto wallet on apps since blockchian and cryptocurrency are complex and require many new knowledge. <br><br>
Don't worry. <br>With EtherWalletKit, you can implement Ethereum wallet without a server and blockchain knowledge.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate EtherWalletKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'EtherWalletKit'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
