# EtherWalletKit

EtherWalletKit is an Ethereum Wallet Toolkit for iOS.<br><br>
I hope cryptocurrency and decentralized token economy become more widely adapted.
However, developers hesitate to add a crypto wallet on apps since blockchian and cryptocurrency are complex and require many new knowledge. <br><br>
Don't worry. With EtherWalletKit, you can implement Ethereum wallet without a server and blockchain knowledge.
